Since oracle ojdbc7/8 or any ojdbcx.jar files need oracle licence, so you must need to download jar from oracle site and then install it in you project.
Step 1:
	Download ojdbc7/8 from oracle site.
	Save that jar at location let say(path : G:/Oracle/ojdbc7.jar)
Step 2:
	Make sure you have installed Maven in your machine
	if not then	
		Step 1(a):
			>Download maven binary file for you respective machine from "https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi"
			>UnZip it in program files, let say (C:/programFiles/apache/maven/bin) is the folder structure after unzip
			>Under System environment path variable
				..Set/create User path with M2_HOME and set path as "C:/programFiles/apache/maven"
				..Make sure you also have JAVA_HOME and path should be of running JDK (not JRE)
				..let say if you have jdk8 path as (c:/programFiles/java/jdk8/bin)
				..then JAVA_HOME path should be "c:/programFiles/java/jdk8"
				..Finally
				..Add in System path variable "C:/programFiles/apache/maven/bin"
				..Save and close that window.
				
Step 3:
	open Command prompt
	check maven version with below commad
	>mvn --version
	Now install downloaded file ojdbc into you project
	let say you project path is "G:/myProject"
	Use below mvn commad to install
	Goto your project path
	G:/myProject>
	>mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file> -DgroupId=<group-id> \
        -DartifactId=<artifact-id> -Dversion=<version> -Dpackaging=<packaging>
	i.e >mvn install:install-file -Dfile=G:/Oracle/ojdbc7.jar -DgroupId=com.oracle \
        -DartifactId=ojdbc7 -Dversion=2.2.0.1 -Dpackaging=jar
		
It will build your jar successfully.
